/**
 * This example shows how to use the touchpad to provide a drawing surface
 * The drawing surface has two modes:
 *   In cursor mode, the drawing pencil is moved without drawing by touching the touchpad.
 *   In draw mode, the drawing pencil will draw when moved around.
 *   Long tap switches mode.
 *   Tap erases the last line.
 *   Double tap erases the entire drawing.

         * This method is called when the user interacts with the touchpad.
         * A TouchEvent always has a gesture code, and may have an optional MotionEvent object.
         *
         * The following gesture codes can be reported:
         *
         * - GESTURE_ENTER
         *   The user has started touching the touchpad.
         *
         * - GESTURE_EXIT
         *   The user has stopped touching the touchpad.
         *
         * - GESTURE_SWIPE_FORWARD
         *   The user has made a forward horizontal swipe gesture, sliding the finger in the user's
         *   looking direction.
         *
         * - GESTURE_SWIPE_BACKWARD
         *   The user has made a backward horizontal swipe gesture, sliding the finger towards the back
         *   of the user's head.
         *
         * - GESTURE_SWIPE_DOWN
         *   The user has mad a downward vertical swipe gesture, sliding the finger towards the ground.
         *
         * - GESTURE_TAP
         *   The user has tapped the touchpad shortly once.  Note that this gesture is reported with a
         *   slight delay to distinguish between a single and a double tap.  If you do not need double taps,
         *   you may want to look for GESTURE_TAP_UNCONFIRMED instead.
         *
         * - GESTURE_TAP_UNCONFIRMED
         *   The user has tapped the touchpad shortly.  This gesture is reported as soon as a tap is
         *   detected without delay.  Hence, it is also reported for the first tap in a double tap
         *   sequence.  It is not reported for the second tap of a double tap.
         *
         * - GESTURE_DOUBLE_TAP
         *   The user has tapped the touchpad twice in a rapid succession.
         *
         * - GESTURE_LONG_TAP
         *   The user is touching the touchpad for an extended amount of time without moving.
         *
         * - GESTURE_NONE
         *   No gesture detected.
         *
         * Fine-grained finger movement may be reported through a MotionEvent object.
         * Some hardware may not support fine-grained reporting, so you should always check that the
         * returned MotionEvent object is not null before using it.
         * The following actions are reported:
         *
         * - ACTION_DOWN
         *   The user has started touching the touchpad (corresponds to GESTURE_ENTER).
         *
         * - ACTION_MOVE
         *   The user's finger is moving on the touchpad.
         *
         * - ACTION_UP
         *   The user's finger has been lifted from the touchpad (corresponds to GESTURE_EXIT).
         *
         * - ACTION_HOVER_MOVE
         *   This action is reported when a gesture has been recognized after the user has stopped touching
         *   the touchpad (e.g., a delayed GESTURE_TAP).  A MotionEvent is still provided to get the X-Y
         *   coordinates of such events.  In most cases however you can simply ignore all MotionEvents with
         *   this action code.
